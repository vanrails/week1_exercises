Week 1 Quiz

What is the value of a after the below code is executed?
a = 1
  b = a
  b = 3
1) a = 1

What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?
2) An array stores values in a sequential index while a hash pairs
     with arbitrary objects.

Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
    [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq
    [1, 2, 3, 3].uniq!
3) line1. [1, 2, 3, 4] # returns a new array
   line2. [1, 2, 3] returns a new array that has removed duplicate values from self
   line3. [1, 2, 3] returns self with duplicate values removed

What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.
4) Both map and select use a block for each element of the array but map creates
     an array that contains the values returned by the block while select returns an array containing the elements for which the block returned true.
     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map{|n| n + 1 } => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].select{|n| n.odd? } => [1, 2, 5]

Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?
5) some_hash = {'1'=>'one', '2'=>'two', '3'=>'three'}

What is returned?
x = 1
  x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"
5) no way!

What is x?

x = 1
  3.times do
    x += 1
  end
  puts x
6) x is an integer that after the iterations is displayed holding a value of 4

What is x?


3.times do
    x += 1
  end
  puts x
7) x is an uninitialized variable. So x = nil.
